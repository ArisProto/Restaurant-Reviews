# Front End Developer Nanodegree Project | Restaurant Reviews

## Objective

Project objective was to take an inaccessible unresponsive website and turn it into a handicapped friendly, fluently responsive website that includes caching for offline usage!

## How to use

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and check out the best restaurants in New York!

#### Sidenote

Due to lack of time, I only focused on implementing the most basic functions. Once I finish my Nanodegree, I will be investing more time in perfecting the website! Enjoy :)
